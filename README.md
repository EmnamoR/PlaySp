# PlaySp

We all know that sport plays a primarily positive role in youth development in addition to physical improvement. It is beneficial to academic achievement, it helps to get higher self-esteem, it can resolve some behavioral problems, and also helps to get better psychosocial.

Also it has long been thought that the many facets of playing team sports are the discipline of training, learning teamwork, following the leadership of coaches and learning to lose. But as our commitments keeps growing it becomes more and more difficult to find time for searching for partners or team members and quickly organize a play.

It's not easy to find other people who can play in the same spare time, or maybe the lack of players in our circle of friends could prevent us to quickly organize a game when suddenly we get free time. There is another issue which consists in finding specific kind of players (low skilled, high skilled etc...) just because we are searching for specific level.

So the challenge is to build a social community around team sports especially sports ball and make it quick and easy for those who want to play so they can find easily their preferences and more. Therefor we aim to promote a real socialization between friends or strangers who share the same passion of playing.
